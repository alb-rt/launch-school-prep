# Variables store and label data in memory.
# IMPT: be thoughtful when naming variables - needs to be accurately descriptive and understandable to another reader (sometimes this ‘other reader’ is you in the future)

# Assign variables with “=“
e.g. first_name = ‘Albert’

=begin 
IMPT: “=“ != “==“
  “=“ assigns value
  “==“ checks if things are equal
    e.g. men == women 
    => true
    (contrary to what many coders might think - ha!)
=end

=begin
Variables don’t like “auto-update” or something:
  e.g.
    a = 4
    b = a
    a = 7
    b = 4 still
=end

# I (person typing in terminal, or textedit in this case) can make variables but Users can store info in variables too.
